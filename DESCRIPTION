Description:
    microbiomeDataSets is a collection of microbiome datasets loaded from 
    Bioconductor'S ExperimentHub infrastructure. The datasets serve as reference
    for workflows and vignettes published adjacent to the microbiome analysis 
    tools on Bioconductor. Additional datasets can be added overtime and 
    additions from authors are welcome.
